Description: Several authors have proposed methods for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions. The package implements seven classical approaches—Wilson, Quesenberry and Hurst, Goodman, Wald (with and without continuity correction), Fitzpatrick and Scott, and Sison and Glaz—along with Bayesian methods based on Dirichlet models. Both equal and unequal Dirichlet priors are supported, providing a broad framework for inference, data analysis, and sensitivity evaluation.
